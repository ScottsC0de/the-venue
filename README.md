## <a id="description-id"></a>Description
'The Venue' is a music blog website created to discover, save, share, and socialize about music. Using the *Spotify Web API* (see [Links](#links-id) below for documentation) and embedded HTML *iframes*, we are able to grab music artists top tracks, a single song, or a Spotify playlist which users can search for in our 'Back Stage' section (see [Site Page Descriptions](#site-descriptions-id) directly below). After signing up and logging in through our 'Security Check' page, users have the option to hit the 'Back Stage' page and discover new music, share it to the 'Main Stage' page or their 'Groupie' account, and comment on posts with other users.</br>

## <a id="usage-id"></a>Usage
Upon arriving to the site (see [Website Link](#website-links-id) below), you will see a login/signup page. Once logged in, you can visit the Main Stage, where all your posts are saved and displayed, the Back Stage, where you can search for new music, or your Groupie account, where you can see and edit your posts.

 When visiting the Back Stage, use the drop down menu to select how you'd like to search for music. There are three different ways to search: by an artist for their top tracks, a single song, or a Spotify playlist. Search in its respective input field and click the 'Get' button. The results should appear in the form of a Spotify 'mini player' in which you can preview any song by simply clicking the provided play button. You then have the option to create a post with a 'Title' and 'Content' and share it to the Main Stage by clicking the 'Share' button. At the Main Stage, you can click on your post and comment on it with other users.
